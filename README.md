# This project is to create a Recommendation software based on user inputs.
## This is a Fashion and Clothing recommendation software that will provide recommendation for available clothing items based on inputs such as body fit, colour and clothing categories.
### I will utilize DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING - LONGEST COMMON Subsequence - to match the user's inputs with the corresponding items and suggect recommendations.
### I will explore if Graphs Traversal will be useful for this, as well.
 I love this already. üòä‚ù§Ô∏è
